\## ✨ About the Project

Welcome to \*\*Magic Quiz\*\*! We were tired of dull, grey tests, so we created a platform where checking your knowledge is visually satisfying.

Our interface is inspired by \*\*Glassmorphism\*\* — featuring semi-transparent elements, soft shadows, and vibrant backgrounds that create a sense of depth and lightness.

\### 🚀 What can you do here?

\* \*\*📝 Create Custom Quizzes:\*\* Add questions, answer options, and share them.  
\* \*\*🧠 Test Yourself:\*\* Take quizzes and get instant results.  
\* \*\*👀 Enjoy the Visuals:\*\* An interface that "breathes" and is easy on the eyes.
